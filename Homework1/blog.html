                Today we have a few changes to the dynamic macronutrients feature. These changes are on the web version only, but will be rolled out in the mobile apps as well in their next updates.

We have had the dynamic macronutrient targets feature for a long time, which lets you set and display preferred macronutrient ratio target. However, the macro targets have always been computed off of a fixed calorie target (the yellow bar).

Today, we are changing this to also be dynamically derived from your energy expenditure (calories burned) and your weight goal. This is more in line with what people expect, and the old behaviour has caused a lot of confusion for people.

                With millions of food products on the global market, keeping our database complete and correct is a big job. We are working on some major projects to improve our curation abilities, and today we have rolled out the first of these improvements. We are making it easier to report issues with our foods so that our curation staff can review and amend any errors and omissions.
